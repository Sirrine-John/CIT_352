    2.  'tty6' is the 6th user interface terminal.  It is a character device because it takes user input character by character. the major number is 4 and the minor is 6
    3.  The file was removed successfully
    4.  I was not successful, it took my username and then did not return any result.
    5.  That command recreated the directory that we forcefully removed.  Performing the ls -l command shows that the directory was recreated.
    6.  I was successful in logging in because the directory exists for tty6 and is now functional
    7.  The files are all tty devices and their major numbers are all the same being the number 4, and their minor numbers are all different and range from 0 to 9, because they are all the same type of device but they are all inidvidual devices.
    8.  There are 162 files in the /dev folder. The total size is 80 kb.  This is becuasse the interfaces are exxentially links and not actually contain data below them in the directory.

        There are 2 tty devices which are major number 4 along with /dev/vc/0. This list is a condensed version of that other list and seems to supress duplicate most major types.

    2.  Current working directory: /root
    3.  Pressing 'cd' did not change the current directory because there was no path specified for the command "cd" to go to
    4.  Pressing 'cd .' did not change the current directory because the "." refers to the current directory
    5.  Pressing 'cd ..' changed the curent directory to '/' because the '..' refers to the previous directory in the tree structure
    6.  The directory changed, I am currently in '/root', I specified a relative path because there was no '/' in front of the path to define the start point for an absolute path
    7.  The error message message I got was '-bash: cd etc: No such file or directory' becuase the 'etc' directory is not in the current working directory
    8.  The directory changed because the '/' introduced the absolute path to navigate to
    9.  The current directory changed back to the root level because this is an absolute path to the root directory
    10. The current directory changed to the same path as it would have if you used '/home/user1'
    11. I used the relative path from my current working directory to the Desktop. I am now at '/home/user1/Desktop'
    13. The relitive pathname took me up a level in the tree path and then the 'sysconfig' took me down into the specified directory
    14. The relative path was acceptable, but the absolute path would have been better because it would have been a shorter command to type

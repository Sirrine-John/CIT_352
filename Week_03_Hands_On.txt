    2.  Current working directory: /root
    3.  Pressing 'cd' did not change the current directory because there was no path specified for the command "cd" to go to
    4.  Pressing 'cd .' did not change the current directory because the "." refers to the current directory
    5.  Pressing 'cd ..' changed the curent directory to '/' because the '..' refers to the previous directory in the tree structure
    6.  The directory changed, I am currently in '/root', I specified a relative path because there was no '/' in front of the path to define the start point for an absolute path
    7.  The error message message I got was '-bash: cd etc: No such file or directory' becuase the 'etc' directory is not in the current working directory
    8.  The directory changed because the '/' introduced the absolute path to navigate to
    9.  The current directory changed back to the root level because this is an absolute path to the root directory
    10. The current directory changed to the same path as it would have if you used '/home/user1'
    11. I used the relative path from my current working directory to the Desktop. I am now at '/home/user1/Desktop'
    13. The relitive pathname took me up a level in the tree path and then the 'sysconfig' took me down into the specified directory
    14. The relative path was acceptable, but the absolute path would have been better because it would have been a shorter command to type

    3.  After pressing Tab the command filled with 'cd root/' because that is the first directory below '/' that the shell found. It contains 1 directory that a starts with 'ro'
    5.  The display did not change when I pressed Tab
    6.  There are 2 directories that begin with 'b'
    7.  The command expanded to cd bin/ because that was the only match in the directory
    8.  There are 2 subdiretories under root that begin with "m"

    3.  There are a bunch of files in the list.  Some of them have extensions, the most abundant extension i see is a '.d' which is referring to 'directory'
    4.  The display shows the files in the current directory in a vertical list with a "--More--" at the end
    6.  The display shows the files in the current directory in a vertical list with a ":" at the end
    9.  The current working directory is '/root'
    10. This time the ls command gave me the contents of the directory I supplied without changing my current working directory.
    11. There were no files listed with the ls command. these files are hidden because they have the '.' in front.
    12. there are 3 regular files and a directory
    13. There was a large list of files in the '/bin' directory.  They are mostly executable files
    14. There is permissions information and creation date and time information.  The 'll' command is an alias to the 'ls -l' command so it shows the same information.
    15. The etc file is a directory
    16. The inittab is an 'ASCII text'
    17. The information is very explicit and is much more descriptive

    2.  The file has 2 files
    5.  The top 10 lines of the inittab file are shown
    6.  With the '-5' command shows the first 5 lines and the '-3' shows the first 3
    7.  The last 10 lines of the inittab file are shown
    8.  The 'tail -5' shows the last 5 lines of the file
    9.  The file is an executable type and should not be opened with a text editor

3-5
    3.  Nothing was displayed because we were not in edit mode.  Text entry can be completed in edit mode
    4.  The cursor did not move, and now we are in command mode.  The 'x' key removed the currently underlined letter and i brougt us into the same position between the 't' and the 'e' and the 'h' got inserted before the cursor
    9.  The display reads '"sample1" [New] 12L, 551C written
    12. The file type is 'ASCII text'
    13. The display reads '"sample1" 12L, 551C' which doesnt have the 'New' flag or the 'written' command from the save option
    15. The date time stamp was placed at the bottom of the file because the r command appends the file where the cursor is currently placed
    16. The 'yy' does a copy not a cut and the 'P' command pastes above the current lines
    19. The 'w' command saved a copy when you gave it a new file name to use
    20. I was not able to quit because there were unsaved changes to the document that hadn't been saved
    23.
